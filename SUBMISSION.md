## Tagline
An AI smart-contract auditor that earns. It has an on-chain ERC-8004 identity,
charges per audit via x402 micropayments, and anchors every report on Mantle so
its work is verifiable and its reputation is portable.

## The problem
Audits are expensive, slow, and gated behind humans and invoices. Meanwhile the
new wave of autonomous agents can *spend* money (they call paid APIs) but almost
none can *earn* it trustlessly or prove the work they did. There's no cheap,
programmatic way for one agent to buy a security check from another and walk away
with a receipt it can verify later.

## What Sentinel does
Point it at a Solidity contract. It:
1. Pay-walls the audit behind a stablecoin micropayment (x402, ~$0.01/contract).
2. Runs an AST-based audit — 14 detectors across security, gas, and
   Mantle/L2-specific footguns — and returns a structured report + 0–100 score.
3. Writes the report hash + risk score to its ERC-8004 Validation Registry on
   Mantle, then settles the payment. The buyer gets a result they can later prove
   is exactly what was anchored; Sentinel accrues an on-chain audit track record.

No accounts, no invoices, no trust assumptions — code paying code, with a receipt.

## Why it fits "AI Awakening"
Most agents are chatbots with a wallet bolted on; they consume. Sentinel is a
self-supporting economic actor: it sells a real service, gets paid trustlessly,
and builds reputation under a portable identity. That's an agent with an economy
around it — the difference between an AI that *uses* money and one that *makes* it.

## How it works (architecture)
- **Audit engine** (`src/analyzer`): `@solidity-parser/parser` AST analysis. Every
  detector is sandboxed — one failing detector can't abort the audit, and
  malformed input returns a clean parser error, never a crash.
- **x402 gateway** (`src/x402`): the x402 "exact" scheme. Unpaid requests get a
  402 with payment requirements; the buyer signs a gasless EIP-3009
  `TransferWithAuthorization` and resends it as `X-PAYMENT`. Settlement happens
  *after* the audit + anchoring succeed, so a buyer never pays for a 402 or a
  failed settlement. The verifier is pluggable: a self-contained `LocalVerifier`
  (offline EIP-712 verify + on-chain settle via a relayer) or a hosted
  `FacilitatorVerifier`.
- **ERC-8004 contracts** (`contracts`): a minimal Identity Registry (agent id
  resolvable by domain/address) and Validation Registry (immutable
  `(auditorAgentId, subjectHash, reportHash, riskScore)` per audit, with `verify()`
  and per-auditor track-record reads).
- **HTTP agent** (`src/server`): serves an ERC-8004 AgentCard and the paywalled
  `/audit` endpoint.

## Detectors (14)
SEC: tx.origin auth, unchecked low-level call/send, selfdestruct, delegatecall to
controlled target, block-property randomness, missing access control,
reentrancy. GAS: require-string→custom error, length-in-loop, `i++`→`++i`,
memory-param-in-public-fn, literal state var→constant. MNT/L2: `block.number` as
time, `.transfer()/.send()` 2300-gas stipend brittleness.

## Demo
`npx tsx scripts/demo.ts` boots a local chain, deploys everything, registers the
agent, and plays a buyer: read AgentCard → 402 → sign x402 payment → paid audit →
report (finds reentrancy + tx.origin, score 43/100) → USDC settles → on-chain
`verify()` returns true.

## What's built (tested) vs. next
**Done & tested** — audit engine, CLI, ERC-8004 registries, x402 gateway, on-chain
attestation, and the full earning loop end-to-end on a live EVM.
Tests: 15/15 vitest (incl. a real signed-payment e2e on Anvil) + 7/7 Foundry, tsc clean.
**Deployed live on Mantle Sepolia (chain 5003):**
- IdentityRegistry: `0x8F18f53a7ED086FFe409933668b2F3c48d26CbF4`
- ValidationRegistry: `0x6925CDFb19606C165d1ce4bCA16895a9a9Ac3507`
- Sentinel agentId `1`, domain `sentinel.audit`, deployer `0x9703C68D01923916D9d9B9f1B824CbE4c8cd501e`
- [View on explorer](https://explorer.sepolia.mantle.xyz/address/0x8F18f53a7ED086FFe409933668b2F3c48d26CbF4)

**Real on-chain audit receipt** — not a simulation: Sentinel audited a vulnerable
`Vault.sol` (5 findings, risk 57/100) and anchored the report hash to the live
Validation Registry as record `#0` for agent `#1` —
[tx `0x0c6ccdba…`](https://explorer.sepolia.mantle.xyz/tx/0x0c6ccdba041e09e33e0ed00c3ac5b6e558fa925ced495228d18a026269290770)
(block 39474514). Reproduce with `PRIVATE_KEY=0x… npm run attest:live`; the
receipt is committed at `media/onchain-attestation.json`.

**Also shipped** — a live, install-free web demo
([sentinel-audit.surge.sh](https://sentinel-audit.surge.sh)): the exact
14-detector audit engine bundled to the browser, so a judge can paste any
contract and see the report + 0–100 score instantly, alongside the live Mantle
Sepolia registry addresses and the x402 earning-loop diagram.

## Demo video
`media/sentinel-demo.mp4` (27s) — title card → the live x402 paid-audit loop
(read AgentCard → 402 → signed EIP-3009 payment → paid audit → USDC settles →
on-chain `verify()` true) → on-chain-proof outro with the live Mantle Sepolia
registry addresses.

## Tech
TypeScript, ethers v6, Express, `@solidity-parser/parser`, Foundry/Solidity 0.8.24,
vitest. ~1.5k LOC of new agent/payment/chain code on top of the audit engine.
